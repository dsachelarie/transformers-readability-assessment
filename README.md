# Performance of Transformer Models in Readability Assessment

This is part of the code which was used for the empirical exploration presented in the paper _Performance of Transformer Models in Readability Assessment_, a TU Delft Research Project. Please check https://github.com/TU-Delft-CSE/Research-Project for more information about this project.

For running the code, you only need to create a virtual environment and then execute the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For ReadNet and the WeeBit dataset, please follow the instructions presented in the [paper](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:3804c3b1-645e-42b8-83e6-120f135f5f93). Also, keep in mind that you will need to download [GloVe](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe) embeddings for running ReadNet.
